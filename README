# Web3 Project: Up and Down Game

## Description
**Up and Down** is a decentralized game built on the [Sui Blockchain](https://sui.io/). Players bet on the evolution of the price of SUI. Each game round involves players placing a bet of 10 SUI. For every round where there’s no clear winner or loser, the pot increases by 1 SUI. The game continues until a winner and a loser are determined, and the winner takes the entire pot. If a player fails to make a move before the time limit, they lose the game automatically.

This project aims to showcase the power of Web3 by providing a fair and transparent betting experience using smart contracts. It ensures that every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, making it secure and verifiable.

## Features
- **Decentralized Gameplay**: All game interactions are executed through smart contracts, ensuring transparency.
- **Real-Time Price Tracking**: Uses live SUI price data to determine winning and losing outcomes.
- **Secure Wallet Integration**: Supports wallet connections through [Mysten Wallet Kit](https://github.com/mysten/wallet-kit).
- **Automated Betting Process**: Automatic updates and transactions via smart contracts, eliminating intermediaries.
